	<h5>Who am I?</h5>
	<p>I am a 21 year old Computer Science Student trying to finish my MsC.
	<h5>What are my favourite Stacks/Areas?</h5>
	<p>I enjoy mostly working with AI and Machine Learning,as well as Graphical Computing and InfoSec.
	<h5>What are my most hated Stacks/Areas?</h5>
	<p>Mostly working on frontend/interfaces and IOT.
	<h5>Why?</h5>
	<p><b>Frontend:</b>
	<p>I just don't really enjoy frontend. The design and UX analysis aspects are really interesting but having to deal with an ungodly ammount of bloated frameworks and JavaScript doesn't really make me happy. 
	<p><b>IOT:</b>
	<p>From my point of view IOT is a solution looking for a problem to solve. Most cases I know of IOT end up being problems that were already solved trying to find a way into the market.
	<h5>What languages have I worked with?</h5>
	<p>Mostly Java, Python, C, C++ and C#. I have also done a paid internship in which I had to use PHP, and JavaScript.
	<p> Besides these, I also understand LUA, SQL, SQL SERVER.
	<h5>Most useful technologies/programs?</h5>
	<p>I really enjoy Linux. Not only because it's really good for productivity, but also because of the community. However in recent times, I've really been enjoying the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) mostly because I need to have both Windows and Linux in my laptop and it's been a really nice experience so far, mostly because I no longer need dual boot and have access to all my files from both OS's.
	<p>Besides WSL, I really enjoy working on either VIM (for small projects) or Visual Studio Code.
	<p>My go-to for writing docs is LaTeX, since it easens the act of writing really long and detailed documents.
	<h5>What Areas/Stacks are you currently interested in?</h5>
	<p>I've always been a really big fan of videogame console emulation and always wanted to work on it, but never actually had the initiative to begin learning how to work on it. I might soon start to look into it and maybe write a simple NES emulator just to begin understanding things better.
	<p>I am also really interested in Game Developments and wanted to try writing a simple game on a simple engine.
	<p>I might also begin delving further into the Graphical Computing stack, since I only have a basic understanding og the OpenGL pipeline and would like to understand it better, as well as try to learn about the Vulkan framework.
